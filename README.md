# Yatspec Example

This is an example Gradle project that uses Yatspec ([nickmcdowall fork](https://github.com/nickmcdowall/yatspec))
to generate the test reports (including sequence diagram).

See `SequenceDiagramExampleTest.java`for a JUnit 5 test skeleton example.

Run the tests the usual way by building the project e.g.:

###Prerequisites:
* Java 11

### Run

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### HTML Report
For reports generated by gradle navigate to: '`$buildDir/reports/yatspec`'
